        <h3 class="faq-title">How old is Geralt?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          A five-year-old Geralt was one of those young initiates, having just
          endured the Trial of the Grasses. By the time Geralt appears in the
          first episode of the Netflix series The Witcher, he is already 71,
          though he is played by 36-year-old Henry Cavill.

      <div class="faq">
        <h3 class="faq-title">Is Ciri Geralts daughter?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Despite their white hair and resemblance, Ciri and Geralt are not
          related to each other by blood. Their destinies are however
          intertwined. Ciri is Geralt's adoptive daughter because of the Law of
          Surprise.

      <div class="faq">
        <h3 class="faq-title">Why is Geralt's hair white?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Geralt exhibited great tolerance to mutagens that grant Witchers their
          abilities, especially in the Trial of the Grasses. As a result, he was
          put through further experiments that caused him to lose all
          pigmentation in his body, turning his skin and hair pale white.
